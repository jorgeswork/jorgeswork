##### Gen Z
Hello, I am one of the [2 billion](https://www.cbi.eu/market-information/tourism/gen-z/market-potential) people considered Gen Z, and one of the not so many that haven't had a youth marked by publicly sharing my life. And now, I feel like that has been a mistake.

I had never had an Instagram account that wasnâ€™t to keep up with MotoGP news, never had a big WhatsApp group chat with friends to send pictures of whatever stupid thing I saw that day, not a Youtube video uploaded, reel, TikTok... you get it. I am not weird, just atypical when it comes to sharing my thoughts and opinions.

I always thought about this closure to public opinion as a good thing. Not being "exposed" to all that algorithmic dopamine made me feel like I understood something that the rest hadn't, which seeing it from the perspective I have now, it's not quite accurate and a bit egocentric. But I am not like that, at least the real me, but the public me, is also me?

I have been navigating the digital life without too much trouble because I have always found people that was willing to put up with my beliefs. They'd call me because I wasn't reading the messages or not push me to post the latest project we had finished on LinkedIn, and that felt good. What has happened is that I have realized that no one outside my close circle knows what I do, think or like. And being a freelance, that's not the way.

I am not saying I am going to start an Insta account or work to become one of LinkedIn's top voice, but I do need to show the public what my thoughts and opinions are for two things. The first and most important is to not feel alone in the digital realm. 

##### AI era
This AI era is making us doubt a lot of stuff, we all have an opinion on what work is going to look like next year, if our job is going to be taken by AI, if Europe is a refuge or a doomed place... and I have a lot of doubts, as well as a lot of opinions that I want to share to either find like minded individuals, or at least stimuli from the ones that don't think alike. Implicit into this action that I am taking expressing my idea of my public figure, is the process of writing, to which I am new at - as you can probably tell - and that has the power of organizing my thoughts and lowering my stress levels.

The other reason I have decided to express my thoughts and opinions is to make it easy for you, stranger, to know me a little bit better. I plan for this to be my presentation book, a transparent wall you can use to decide if my words stimulate you, bring you new ideas or just a moment of entertainment in the subway, and maybe, ideally make us get in touch to share, debate or work together.

So, no, I'm not going to show my vacation trip on Instagram or talk about how no one answers my emails on LinkedIn, but not because I think that's wrong but because that doesn't make me feel good. I don't want this to sound like a critic to the people that do, because I am the first to enjoy taking a sneak peak of the villa Marc Marquez is spending the summer in, or the thrill of someone telling their companies latest failure on LinkedIn. It's probably unfair, but I am going to share my thoughts, ideas and analysis on places where I feel the people that might be interested on reading it are.

So far Substack is the place I tend to spend the most time lately, and not because the new Notes feature feeds my brain the right way, but because the creators there stimulate me the most. Also, I have understood the joy of long "er" form content like Substacks newsletters or articles that feel like the back of a book, you get the idea but to know more you have to open the book, or in this case, subscribe to keep reading that creators mind.

##### The goal
That's the goal of this publication, to spark interest, stimulate your curiosity, maybe even plant the seed of a new idea, startup, Substack post...  And if you want the extra juicy part of my brain, we can talk and get to a collaboration. That'd be amazing.

Yesterday I was telling my partner that my work frustration comes from not really getting to feel like my ideas are filtering to the person in front of me. That's why I left my consultancy job, that's why I think sharing my ideas is the only way of getting to know you, reader.

I have many ideas for Substack publications to express my ideas.:
- Some are reflective posts like this one, in which the format is basically writing my thoughts.
- Another is a novel styled publication to tell the crazy stories I have lived in my big company consultancy era. Novel-style to avoid hurting real people, using fictional characters instead.
- I also thought about dividing the topics I would like to talk about into small but more segregated publications. Something like:
	- About my thoughts of perfectionism and blockage.
	- About energy, human consumption and AI.
	- About Europe competing in the world.
	- About Wellness, work-life balance, what's the world expecting of my generation.
	- About startups, systems, decisions and processes.
	- About books I read.
	- About team management and dynamics.
	- About the future of work, what will the human do when AI takes our jobs?

I think I've made my point. This is the start of my publicly sharing my thoughts in the digital realm. For which I am decades late, but I choose the time when I am ready to do something, not anyone else. I told you at the beginning I am an atypical Gen Z specimen.

If you made it to the end of this first article, thank you. I will buy you a coffee in Madrid. For real.

If you have a comment to make about this article, I will forever be grateful to you for taking the time and effort of sharing it.

Pd. Clearly, english is not my mother tongue... and I am rusty, but I will improve quickly. That's my super power, I am a very fast learner. AI does help me finding words or making sure my phrases make sense - sometimes - but I think this is a place for humans, and when we are all out of jobs we will turn to reading, writing and sun bathing and we will want content made by humans.

Jorge.

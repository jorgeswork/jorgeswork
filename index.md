> [!info] Hola, I'm Jorge.
> This is the website where you can find a bit more about what I do and why I do it. It's the first time I have made something public by design, which being Gen Z isn't common. You can read more about it here [[Being public feels mandatory]]

#### Entrepreneur
If I have to define myself with one tag that'd be entrepreneur, but that's a very broad definition, and in many cases, subject to your definition of success. [insert article about success?] Many of the [[Historic projects]] I have started have not been successful money wise, but have taught me a lot. Enough to start feeling like I can achieve an impact with my current ones.

#### Interests
Besides updating on my projects and using this site as a public presentation place, I want to have a place of my own to expose my thinking. In the [thoughts] page you can read my opinion or analysis on various subjects I am interested in. Some of this areas of interest are: startups, business development, technology (not only AI), renewable energies and wellness.

#### My experience
I am a professional passionate about **technology, with experience in business and technology consulting.** I love working on system strategies, business operations, and process optimization to drive innovation and scalability in startups and established companies.

I have collaborated with companies in various sectors, from legal to health, always with **technology as a fundamental pillar.** Some clients were technology companies with teams to implement changes at the executive level, while in other cases, I provided the ideas and the plan to implement the needs using tools like Notion, Microsoft, or Google. Being a bridge between the technical and executive team was one of my most valued skills. I consider myself a good listener, which has allowed me to act as a facilitator and accelerate projects.

However, being a facilitator sometimes **made me seem indispensable to the client**, something I avoid, as my vision of business models and process management is **based on the idea that no one should be irreplaceable**. I have found that this mindset makes companies more resilient.

#### Degree in Leadership, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation (LEINN)

Graduated in 2020 I graduated from the University of Mondrag√≥n, a degree that **took me to China, India, Finland, back to the United States**, and many other very interesting places.

The program focused on the concept of **learning by doing, entrepreneurship, and team management.** During those years, I participated in projects ranging from clothing brands, food and beverage startups, seasonal product offerings, and the most interesting one, which encompassed all the others, the main company that served as a launch platform for all these smaller projects.

I learned a lot about **team management**, demystifying many cultural perceptions about how to **handle stress, what the meaning of success is**, and why money will never surpass passion and the execution of an idea.
